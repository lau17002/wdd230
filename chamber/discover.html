            <p>Brigham Young University-Idaho is a college in the heart of Rexburg. This attracts a lot of students to live here. They offer activities every week, there is a food court, 
                library, gym, pool, and outdoor track. Small businesses also operate on campus doing a portion of each semester, you can support them by finding them in the MC, Smith, or 
                Smith quad (outside of the library). Each building on campus has a purpose. The Smith building is the accounting and business building. Visit the Spori if you want to view 
                student art of all types!

            <p>Porter Park is one of the two parks in Rexburg. It is in a great location, right across the street from Jimmy Johns, Five Guys, and Crumbl Cookie. It is great for picnics, 
                hammocking, soccer, frisbee, and many other outdoor actitivties. While it is primilarily a grass filled area, there are also other attractions. They have a basketball court,
                a water splash pad, picnic tables and pavailions, and a carousel! Events are often held here such as the Rexburg Farmer's Market which brings bounce houses, food trucks, and 
                small venues.</p>

            <p>Rexburg Rapids is a great place for children and adults! They have a lazy river, slides, a rock wall, a lap pool, and a children's play area. They provide lockers, changing
                rooms, and showers. If you forgot to bring snacks, then you can just get a snack from their concession stands where they provide hotdogs, pizza, churros, ICEE's and candy! 
                Swim lessons are provided throughout the season with experienced instructors. Summer birthdays can be held here by purchasing the party package. Overall, this is the perfect 
                summer activity for families!

            <p>This mural is one of the few in Rexburg. They are perfect for group or solo pictures to capture memories. This particular wall is right outside of Jamba juice. It would be perfect
                for a date at Jamba and then finishing it off with a few pictures! There is also a mountain wall with blue and pink hues. A more upbeat wall with orange, pink, and yellow stripes 
                and a smiley face. Lastly,a wall with an engagement ring on it. Rexburg doesn't have many fun locations for photos so this is a must see. Visitors wouldn't regret
                a quick pic with one of these murals!

            <p>There is one building that everyone can see from most points in Rexburg. It is the Rexburg Temple. The grounds are open to any individual that would like a peaceful walk. There are benches, 
                shade from trees, and beautiful flowers. It is right besides an open field so it would be a perfect view for a quiet picnic. It is entirely light during the night and an top of a hill, making
                it a beacon at night. Overall, this is the perfect location to take a break from the stress of school or work to be able to reflect on your life and to feel peaceful for a few minutes.
